Scoring rules:
- The person(s) closest to 21 points without going over wins.
- Number cards are their value (1 =1, 2 = 2, etc)
- King, Queen, and Jack cards are 10
- Ace can be counted as 1 or 11 (playerâ€™s choice).
- If someone scores over 21 they are disqualified.
- Anyone using over 5 cards is disqualified.

Some example hands:

~~~
A, J => 21
A, 10, A => 12
8, A, A => 20
5, 3, 7 => 15
K, Q, J => went over 21!
